# VBA-challenge
multi-year stock data (homework 2)

Sub_ticker.vbs file contains the script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the ticker symbol.

Sub_yearly_change.vbs files contains the script that output the following:

1) yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year;
2) the percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year;
3) the total stock volume of the stock.

You should also have conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
